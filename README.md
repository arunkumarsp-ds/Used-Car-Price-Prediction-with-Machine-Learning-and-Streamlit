## Introduction

In this project, I aim to build a predictive model that estimates the selling price of used cars based on various features. This analysis involves constructing a machine learning model and conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns within the data.

## Goal

The primary goal is to assist potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions by predicting car prices based on historical data. This model can help in pricing used cars more effectively, ultimately benefiting both consumers and dealers.

## Key Highlights

- Built a model using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, and XGBoost, improving the score from **56% to 92% accuracy** with Hyperparameter-Tuned XGBoost.
- Conducted **EDA** and **feature engineering** for model building, with insights documented in the notebook.
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** using `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize model performance.
- Developed a basic **Streamlit app** for real-time price predictions.
